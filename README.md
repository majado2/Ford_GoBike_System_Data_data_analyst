**Data Wrangling summary**
In this analysis, I checked the data from the missing values and also made sure of the correct data type. I also corrected some ages that were written incorrectly to the closest logical result option, and also I dropped all rows that do not contain a specification for the user type or the gender of the user because it is essential to our research. I added a column For the age calculated from the date of birth. I also added a column for the day the trip started in a week calculated from the date the trip started. I also added a column for the duration of the trip in minutes calculated from the duration of the trip in seconds.



## Summary of Findings

> Through the above research, we notice in general that the majority of users are male, and we also note that subscribers are more than customers\
We have noticed that with age, the duration of the trip decreases\
Saturday, Sunday, and Monday have been considered the most increase in the duration of the trip between the days of the week for customers compared to other days.\
And when comparing the duration of the trip during the hours of the day, we find that from one o'clock to four o'clock the duration of the trip is longer, with a big difference for customers, as well as women and (gender not specified)\
Conclusion: The duration of the trip for customers is more than the duration of the trip for subscribers, \
and the duration of the trip from  1 to 4 o'clock  is more than the average duration during the hours of the day.


## Key Insights for Presentation

Is there a difference in the average duration of the trip during the hours of the day with the types of users or Member Gender?\
